# Sweater Weather
-----------------

Sweater Weather uses a seperate front end and back end app to implement service oriented architecture.

Sweater Weather FE is a front end app that consumes the data from the [Sweater Weather API](https://github.com/abdullaqudrat/sweater_weather_api) and displays it using JavaScript. A visitor can input a city to receive the current and future forecast. The search results will also display a landmark or skyline for that city using images from Flickr.

* CSS
* JQUERY
